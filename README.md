Hey, I'm Giovana! How’s it going? 😅

I'm a Software Quality Analyst, specializing in Cypress, where I handle both manual and automated testing, including API automation and frontend end-to-end testing.

I got into Software Testing because every time I used a website or app, there were things that bothered me. I would think, 'This could definitely be better!' or, 'Has anyone tested this? This doesn’t even look like a button!' That’s when I realized that quality is essential, and I wanted to be part of making things better. And that’s how I became a QA Analyst. I make sure everything works perfectly before it gets to the end user. 📦💻

When I'm not testing software, I'm the energetic, extroverted person who loves to chat, make new friends, and enjoy the sun (just call me when it's summer, that's my season!). ☀️😎

Would you like to find me?
